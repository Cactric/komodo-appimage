The binaries for the Komodo program were taken from my university's cloud Linux VM
	As far as I know they've used the official [source code](https://github.com/UoMCS/komodo)
The binaries for the libraries (like gtk and glib) were taken from deb files from an old version of Ubuntu

Thank you to everyone who helped me in trying to get it installed so I could make an AppImage of it.
