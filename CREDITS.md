The binaries for the Komodo program were taken from the University of Nottingham's cloud Linux VM
	As far as I know they've used the official [source code](https://github.com/UoMCS/komodo)
The binaries for the libraries (like gtk and glib) were taken from deb files from an old version of Ubuntu

Thank you to James Harvey for sending me the Komodo binaries from the UoN VM
