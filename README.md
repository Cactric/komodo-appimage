# komodo-appimage
An AppImage for Komodo - the Komodo Manchester Debugger
Komodo is a debugger for ARM assembly, written by the University of Manchester

[Homepage](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo)

I made an AppImage for it because it's a pain to get it to compile on modern distros since it relies on old versions of gtk and glib

## Running
Running the AppImage without any arguments will run kmd inside with the -e flag (this is so that it will work just by double-clicking on distros that support it)

Just double clicking it in your distro's file manager may work, see the [official AppImage docs](https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html) if it doesn't.
